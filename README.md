# Expense Reimbursement Project

## Project Description

This is a project used to help teach me the how to use java servlets and to better integrate databases. It also served as an introduction to HTML and javascript. The idea of the project is that two types of users can login, an admin and an employee. An employee can request a reimbursement, and view a list of outstanding and previous requests. An admin can approve or deny requests, and can see all requests made, and their current standing.
